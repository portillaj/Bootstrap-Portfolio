            <p class="text-justify my-bio">My name is Jason Portilla, and I am 31 years old. I am originally from New York, but Apopka has been my home since I was 12 years old. In 2003 I graduated from Apopka High School and went on to attend the University of Central Florida where I earned a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Criminal Justice.

            Once I graduated in 2009, I pursued a career as a Police Officer for the Orlando Police Department. I have been a Police Officer for 8 years. During these years, I have been assigned to several areas throughout the city, patrolling neighborhoods, and building a relationship with the community. I have volunteered to help kids in the community and guide them towards a positive future.

            Throughout my life, computers have always been my passion. Even as a police officer, I often found myself in front of a computer learning code using programs like Treehouse and Codeacademy, on my days off. Computers have always been something I wanted to pursue. An opportunity arose when I discovered a course offered through the University of Central Florida that suits my current schedule as a working husband and father of two. This was it, my opportunity to make my dreams come true.</p>
